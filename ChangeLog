   * Use of async_manager class to manage all double-buffered workflow
   * Removal of support for post-processing of a decoded and loaded batch (was only used for packing transcripts)
   * Performance optimizations for batch processing pipeline

* Bug fix for clean termination


## v0.2.5 (2016-11-15)

   * Associated unit tests
* Bug fix for format handling in sox when running in
* Prevent multiple processes from writing to same cache at the same time
    * Use crc to compute cache hash based on manifest content instead of modification time
    * Associated unit tests

* Localization improvements
    * Bug fix: Handle >64 ground truth bounding boxes
* Image improvements
    * Add 'hue' argument to image augmentation where 'hue' can be set from 0..360 degrees
* Stereo provider improvements
    * stereo_image,blob provides direct passthrough of arbitrary binary blob


## v0.2.0 (2016-09-23):
* Improved documentation
* Audio improvements
    * Sox based extraction to handle more formats natively
    * Time domain output
    * Bug Fix: normalization for spectral outputs to ignore padded regions
* Image improvements
    * Unified image handling for variable sized images and fixed output sizes
    * Bug fix: correct photometric augmentation
* Additional provider types
    * Localization provider for faster-rcnn style networks
    * Stereo image provider
