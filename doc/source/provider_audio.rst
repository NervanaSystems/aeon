audio
=====

In order to build Aeon with audio support you need to compile Aeon with cmake flag ``USE_SOX=ON``.

For audio data, Aeon has providers for both classification and transcription tasks. Currently, audio can be stored in any file format handled by the sox_ command line utility (e.g. .wav, .mp3, .aiff), but must first be converted to 16-bit, single channel. This conversion is done by the user before calling the dataloader. For example, to convert ``*.wav`` files to the correct format, one could use:

.. code-block:: bash

    find . -name '*.wav'  | parallel 'sox {} -b 16 {} channels 1 rate 16k'

This single line finds all ``*.wav`` files and converts them in-place and in parallel using sox.

From there, the user should create a manifest file that specifies paths to both the audio and any target files. To provision just the audio data, the manifest would just list the audio files, one per line::

    @FILE
    audio_sample_1.wav
    audio_sample_2.wav
    audio_sample_3.wav

When the data is provisioned to the model, Aeon can output the raw waveform (``feature_type: samples``) or transform it into three different feature spaces: spectrograms (``feature_type: specgram``), mel-frequency spectral coefficients (``feature_type: mfsc``), or mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (``feature_type: mfcc``). The full provisioning pipeline is described below, along with some key parameters:

1.  Extract the samples corresponding to the raw audio waveform from the encoded file or buffer. If ``feature_type`` is "samples", then we can stop here.

.. image:: spectrogram.png
    :scale: 20 %
    :align: center
    :alt: "Spectrogram"

2. Compute a spectrogram from the audio waveform. The resolution is determined by the ``frame_length`` parameter and the stride by the ``frame_stride`` parameter. If ``feature_type`` is "specgram", then we can stop here.

.. image:: mfsc.png
    :scale: 20 %
    :align: center
    :alt: "Mel-frequency spectral coefficients"

3. Compute the mel-frequency spectral coefficients (MFSC) from the spectrogram. The resulting MFSC has ``num_filters`` mel-frequency bands, where each band is a  weighted combination of frequency bands from the input spectrogram, according to the mel scale. If ``feature_type`` is "mfsc", then we can stop here.

.. image:: mfcc.png
    :scale: 20 %
    :align: center
    :alt: "Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients"

4. Compute the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) from the MFSC. The resulting MFCC has ``num_cepstra`` cepstral bands.

The complete table of configuration parameters is shown below:

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Name", "Default", "Description"
   :widths: 20, 20, 40
   :delim: |
   :escape: ~

    max_duration (string)| *Required* | Maximum duration of any audio clip ("seconds" or "samples", e.g. "4 seconds")
    frame_stride (string)| *Required* | Interval between consecutive frames ("seconds" or "samples")
    frame_length (string)| *Required* | Duration of each frame ("seconds" or "samples")
    sample_freq_hz (uint32_t)| 16000 | Sample rate of input audio in hertz
    feature_type (string)| ~"specgram~" | Feature space to represent audio. One of "samples", "specgram", "mfsc", or "mfcc"
    window_type (string)| ~"hann~" | Window type for spectrogram generation. Currently supported windows are "hann", "hamming", "blackman", and "bartlett".
    num_filters (uint32_t)| 64 | Number of filters to use for mel-frequency transform (used for feature_type = "mfsc" or "mfcc")
    num_cepstra (uint32_t)| 40 | Number of cepstra to use (only for feature_type = "mfcc")
    noise_index_file (string)| | File of pathnames to noisy audio files, one per line.
    noise_level (tuple(float, float))| (0.0, 0.5) | How much noise to add (a value of 1 would be 0 dB SNR). Each clip applies its own value chosen randomly from with the given bounds.
    add_noise_probability (float)| 0.0 | Probability of adding noise
    time_scale_fraction (tuple(float, float))| (1.0, 1.0) | Scale factor for simple linear time-warping. Each clip applies its own value chosen randomly from with the given bounds.
    emit_length (bool) | False | Produce a buffer indicating the length of the audio output buffer
    output_type (string)| ~"uint8_t~"| Output data type. If feature_type = "samples" then this should be "int16" or "float". Otherwise it should stay at "uint8_t".

You can configure the audio processing pipeline from python using a dictionary as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    audio_config = {"type": "audio",
                    "sample_freq_hz": 16000,
                    "max_duration": "3 seconds",
                    "frame_length": "256 samples",
                    "frame_stride": "128 samples",
                    "noise_index_file": "/path/to/noise_index_file",
                    "window_type": "hann"}

    augmentation_config = {"type": "audio",
                           "add_noise_probability": 0.5,
                           "noise_level": (0.5, 1.0)}

When providing audio only, the buffers provisioned to the model are:

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Buffer Name", "Shape", "Description"
   :widths: 20, 10, 45
   :delim: |
   :escape: ~

   audio | ``(N, F, T)`` | Transformed audio, where ``F = number of bands``, ``T = max timepoints``, and ``N = bsz`` (the batch size).
   audio_length | ``(N)`` | Length of audio buffer in ``output_type`` units.  Only produced if ``emit_length`` is true in the configuration.
