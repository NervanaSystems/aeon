Getting Started
===============

Installation
------------

First grab aeon's dependencies:

Ubuntu::

  apt-get install git clang libopencv-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-system-dev

Centos::

  yum install epel-release
  yum install git clang gcc-c++ make cmake opencv-devel boost-devel boost-filesystem boost-system

OSX (Assuming you followed neon's Homebrew based install)::

  brew tap homebrew/science
  brew install opencv
  brew install boost


Then build the aeon libraries::

    git clone https://github.com/NervanaSystems/aeon.git
    mkdir -p aeon/build && cd $_ && cmake .. && pip install .

Now continue on to the :doc:`user_guide` to get started using aeon. Or to the
:doc:`developer_guide` to developing custom loaders/transformers.
