image
=====

For image provision module is used for image classification, segmentation, and localization tasks. We support any image format that can be decoded with OpenCV.

The complete table of configuration parameters is shown below:

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Parameter", "Default", "Description"
   :widths: 20, 10, 50
   :delim: |
   :escape: ~

   height (uint) | *Required* | Height of provisioned image (pixels)
   width (uint) | *Required* | Width of provisioned image (pixels)
   name (string) | ~"~" | Name prepended to the output buffer name
   output_type (string)| ~"uint8_t~"| Output data type.
   channels (uint) | 3 | Number of channels in input image
   channel_major (bool)| True | Load the pixel buffer in channel major order (that is, all pixels from blue channel contiguous, followed by all pixels from green channel, followed by all pixels from the red channel).  The alternative is to have the color channels for each pixel located adjacent to each other (b1g1r1b2g2r2 rather than b1b2g1g2r1r2).
   bgr_to_rgb (bool) | False | Reorder output to RGB instead of the default BGR.
   seed (int) | 0 | Random seed

The buffers provisioned to the model are:

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Buffer Name", "Shape", "Description"
   :widths: 20, 10, 45
   :delim: |
   :escape: ~

   image | ``(N, C, H, W)`` or ``(N, H, W, C)``| Extracted and transformed image, where ``C = channels``, ``H = height``, ``W = width``, and ``N = bsz`` (the batch size).  Layout is dependent on whether ``channel_major`` mode is true or not
