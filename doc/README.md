# Documentation

Documentation is available at aeon.nervanasys.com
Files in this directory are not meant to serve as github documentation as they
use Sphinx custom directives for reStructuredText implementation.
To compile documentation, install prerequisites with ``./install_prereqs``. It uses ``apt``, so you need to modify it if you don't work on Ubuntu. After that, run ``make doc html`` for html documentation.
