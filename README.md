# aeon

[aeon](https://github.com/NervanaSystems/aeon) is Intel Nervana's framework-independent deep learning dataloader committed to best performance. Designed for ease-of-use and extensibility.

- Supports common media types: image, video, audio. It is ready for use with classification, segmentation, localization, transcription and more.
- Loads and augments data in parallel to framework computation.
- [Examples](examples) folder contains simple scripts showing how to use it.

For fast iteration and model exploration, it is already used by fastest performance deep learning framework [neon](https://github.com/NervanaSystems/neon).

See the new features in our latest release.

# Getting Started

## Installation

First grab Aeon's dependencies:

### Ubuntu (release 16.04 LTS and later):

    apt-get install git clang libcurl4-openssl-dev libopencv-dev libsox-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-system-dev libssl-dev

##### For Python 3.n

    apt-get install python3-dev python3-pip python3-numpy

### CentOS (release 7.2 and later):

    yum install epel-release
    yum install git clang gcc-c++ make cmake openssl-devel opencv-devel libcurl-devel sox-devel boost-devel boost-filesystem boost-system

##### For Python 2.7

    yum install python-pip python-devel

##### For Python 3.n

    yum install python-pip python34-pip python34-devel python34-opencv python34-numpy

### OSX:

    brew tap homebrew/science
    brew install opencv
    brew install sox
    brew install boost

## Distributed Aeon

Please take a look at [distributed documentation](http://aeon.nervanasys.com/index.html/service.html).

## Code coverage

    Code coverage in aeon depends on llvm-cov and lcov.
    Report will be generated in html-coverage-report/index.html

    Example:

    sudo apt-get install llvm lcov
    mkdir build
    cd build
    # COVERAGE flag must be set to generate coverage report
    cmake .. -DCOVERAGE=ON
    # If you want to generate report when unit test fails: make -i coverage
    make coverage

### To install Aeon:

    git clone https://github.com/NervanaSystems/aeon.git

##### For Python 2.7

    cd aeon
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    mkdir -p build && cd $_ && cmake .. && pip install .

##### For Python 3.n

    cd aeon
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    mkdir -p build && cd $_ && cmake .. && pip3 install .

Note: if installing system wide (as opposed to within a virtual environment) you may need to run `sudo`

Now continue on to the [user guide](http://aeon.nervanasys.com/index.html/user_guide.html) to get started using aeon. Or to the
[developer guide](http://aeon.nervanasys.com/index.html/developer_guide.html) to developing custom loaders/transformers.
